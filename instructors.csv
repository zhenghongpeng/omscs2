He has been associated with the Georgia Tech Information Security Center since 1998, including serving as its director from 2004 to 2012. GTIISP seeks to proactively work on understanding challenges associated with workforce development in cyber security. With oversight of formal degree programs and continuing education for working professionals, he is an advocate for greater cybersecurity education and training in order to meet the collective needs of industry and government.

Professor Ahamad's research interests are in the areas of converged communications security and security of healthcare systems. As smart phone like devices enable ubiquitous access to web and voice channels, the convergence of telephony with the Internet gives rise to new cross-channel threats that can combine online and voice attacks. For example, voice phishing with caller-id spoofing has been reported for stealing online banking credentials. His data-driven research approach for exploring cross-channel threats has resulted in better understanding of these threats and more effective ways to combat them. In the healthcare security area, he has worked on monitoring for detection of abuse and fraud.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O-t4q4GN_9jStM19fbhnD0yHY0B_3dEbGJxaVX6K9rtKxiDaWX0Q-Ta_8J_R-AQPvY5akkODKrRF5PdPn34=s0#w=200&h=250,Mustaque Ahamad,ud459,Intro to Information Security,Georgia Tech Masters in CS
